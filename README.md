# Photog Finder

<img src="public/screenshot.png" alt="project 4 display">

Photog Finder is an app that allows visitors to search for wedding photographers by zip code and view contact information and a selection of images for each photographer.  Photographers can log in, create and edit profiles, and upload and delete images.

Photog Finder uses Zip Code API to find the zip codes within a 20-mile radius of the zip code entered by the user/visitor and returns all of the photographers in the database that have one of the matching zip codes.

Note: This app is currently in development.  It's a work in progress!
